### What is Fx bridge (fx-portal)?

**It is a powerful yet simple implementation Polygon [state sync](https://docs.matic.network/docs/contribute/state-sync) mechanism. Polygon PoS bridge is based on it. The code in the `examples` folder are examples of the usage of this methodology. You can use these examples to build your own implementations or own custom bridge.**

In short, it's Meta bridge. This bridge allows any state-syncs without mapping.

#### Some use-cases of Fx-portal

* [ERC20 token tranfer from Ethereum to Matic-Chain without mapping request](https://github.com/jdkanani/fx-portal/tree/main/contracts/examples/erc20-transfer)
* [Lazy minting of ERC20 tokens on MaticChain](https://github.com/jdkanani/fx-portal/tree/main/contracts/examples/mintable-erc20-transfer)
* [State Transfer between Ethereum-Matic](https://github.com/jdkanani/fx-portal/tree/main/contracts/examples/state-transfer)

**What about [PoS portal](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/ethereum-matic/pos/getting-started)?**

PoS Portal is another bridge, but it works only for few ERC standards and requires mappings. It is more developer-friendly, allows customization without much headache. 

While Fx-portal focuses on permissionless-ness and flexibility, a developer might have to write more code but more customizable than PoS Portal. It requires no mapping.

**Can I build my bridge?**

Yes. You can check docs here: https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/ethereum-to-matic

### What are FxChild and FxRoot?

`FxChild` (FxChild.sol)  and `FxRoot` (FxRoot.sol) are main contracts on which mapping-less bridge works. It calls and passes data to user-defined methods on another chain without mapping.

You can deploy your own `FxChild` and `FxRoot`, but no need. Except you want to have some fun and have extra ETH to throw away.

### What can I build with it?

* Arbitrary state bridge (examples/state-transfer)
* Normal ERC20 bridge (examples/erc2-transfer)
* ERC20 token generator bridge (example/mintable-erc20-transfer)
